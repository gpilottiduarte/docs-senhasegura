# How to use domain credentials

Domain credentials are used when a credential needs to access different machines in the same domain.

## Requirements

- Have a credential that **isn’t** a registered **Local user**.
- Have a device that is in the same domain as the credential.

## How to register a domain

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares, and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Settings > Credentials > Domains > Domain settings**.
3. To register a new domain, click the **+** button, identified by the plus sign, next do the **New domain** title.
4. Two new empty fields will be added just below the last domain registered. Fill in the information:
    1. **Domain**: URL, IP address, or hostname of the domain.
    2. **Domain (Short Name)**: friendly name for the domain.
5. Click **Save**.

## How to add a device to a domain

If you don't have any devices registered yet, register a new one. Access the How to configure a device documentation for more information on registering a device.

If you already have a device registered and want to link it to the domain, access the device list and edit it. To do this, follow the instructions below:

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares, and select **Devices**.
2. In the side menu, select **Devices**.
3. In the list of devices, identify the one you want to edit.

In both cases, the way to add the device to a domain is the same:

1. On the **Device Registration** form, on the **Information** tab, in the **Domain Settings** section, click the plus sign next to the word **Add**.
2. In the **Domain** drop-down menu, select the domain to which you want to link this device. It must be the same domain that you registered and linked your credential to previously.
3. Click **Save**.

## How to register a type of credential to use with a domain

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares, and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Settings > Credentials > Credential types**.
3. In the top bar, click the **Display actions** button, identified by the three vertical dots, and select **+ New**.
4. On the **Registration** **Credential type** form, fill in the following fields:
    1. **Name**: a name for the type of credential to be registered.
    2. **Local user**: for domain credentials, setting this option to **No is mandatory**. Otherwise, the credential won’t be able to connect by domain.
    3. **Enabled**: check **Yes**.
5. Click **Save**.
