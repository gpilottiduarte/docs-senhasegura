# Administrative users

senhasegura provides two key administrative users for system management:   

* `mt4adm` for SSH access.
* `mt4web` for web interface administration. 

It’s crucial to prioritize the security of administrative passwords to prevent any unauthorized access or potential risks.

 :::danger
For security reasons, it is recommended to change the administrative username **'admin'** during first login. See the [How to change the default password](/v3-32/docs/orbit-cli-how-to-change-default-passwords) documentation for detailed instructions.

 :::warning
Upon your initial login, you’ll be prompted to establish a new password. Make sure to choose a strong password and securely store it. Avoid saving the new password within the senhasegura application.

 :::danger
After modifying administrative user passwords, prioritize their security. The loss of this password will lead to a permanent inability to access the senhasegura platform.
