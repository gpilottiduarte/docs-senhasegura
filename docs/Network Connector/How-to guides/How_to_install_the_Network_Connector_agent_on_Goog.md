# How to install the Network Connector agent on Google Cloud

In this document, you will find a step-by-step guide on how to install the **Network Connector** on Google Cloud.

 :::info Use the automatic container configuration functions available in the instance creation interface of Compute Engine to simplify the process. :::

## Create instance on Google Cloud

1. Go to the **Compute Engine** page in the Google Cloud dashboard.
2. Select the option **VM Instances** no menu lateral.
3. Click in **Create Instance** to start the process of creating a new instance
4. On the instance creation screen, define a name for the instance and choose the desired region.
5. Make the following changes to the configuration parameters:
    * Series: E2.
    * Machine Type: e2-small.
6. In **Container**, click on the button **Deploy Container** define the fields:
    * **Container Image** as `registry.senhasegura.io/network-connector/agent-v2:latest`.
    * **Restart policy** as `Always`.
7. In **Environment Variables**, define the fields:
    * `SENHASEGURA_FINGERPRINT`: The fingerprint as seen in senhasegura.
    * `SENHASEGURA_AGENT_PORT`: The port defined in the senhasegura interface.
    * `SENHASEGURA_ADDRESSES`: IPs of machines running senhasegura.
    * `SENHASEGURA_AGENT_SECONDARY`: As `true` or `false`.
8. In `Advanced Configuration` select the option `Management`.
