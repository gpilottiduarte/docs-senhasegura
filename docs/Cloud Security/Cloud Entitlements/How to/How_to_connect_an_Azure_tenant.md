## Connect an Azure tenant

To connect an Azure tenant to **Cloud Entitlements**, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the left menu within **Cloud Entitlements**.
2. Click **Cloud setup** to open the dropdown menu.
3. From the drop-down menu, select **Microsoft Azure**.
4. Click the **+ Connect** button on the screen's upper right corner.
5. Enter a **Name** to identify your Azure tenant within **Cloud Entitlements**.
6. Enter the **Tenant ID**.
7. Enter the **Secret value**.

:::info
The **Secret value** won’t be visible after connecting with the tenant.
:::

8. Enter the **Application ID**.
9. If needed, attribute tags to the tenant. Separate each tag by pressing the **Enter** key.

:::info
It's not possible to use different App registrations that belong to the same tenant, as it would cause duplicity.
:::

10. Click **Save**.

If the connection is successful, your Azure tenant will appear in the list of connected accounts.

:::danger
If the connection is unsuccessful, review the API permissions, the role, and the client secret. You can't use the secret of a tenant that is already connected to **Cloud Entitlements**.

To make any necessary changes, click the **Actions** button, represented by three vertical dots, and click **Edit**.

Additionally, you can activate or deactivate the tenant by turning the **Status switch** on or off.
