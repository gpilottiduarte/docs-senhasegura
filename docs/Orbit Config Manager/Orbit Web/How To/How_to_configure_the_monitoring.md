# How to configure the monitoring

In this documentation we will only describe the hardware, operating system and monitoring services that can be queried through the **SNMP** protocol and the **[Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com/)** agent. In addition to **SYSLOG** messages that can be forwarded to **SIEM** systems and notification emails triggered by **Orbit**.
:::info
Some notifications are sent via **email** or **SMS** to configured users.
:::
:::warning
We don't allow the installation of monitoring agents not approved by the senhasegura . Only the tools described in this document are approved for use.
:::

## Monitoring through Zabbix
:::info
The installed version of **Zabbix Agent** is **4.0**. If you need to install a higher version, please contact our support team. 
:::
By default, the **Zabbix Agent** service will be inactive on the instance. To activate it, access the menu **Orbit Config Manager > Server > Services**, locate the **Zabbix Agent** service and click on the **Start action**.

To configure the **Zabbix Server** that will receive the data:

1. Go to menu **Orbit Config Manager > Settings > Application**.
2. Fill in the **Server IP** and **Server Connection Port** fields with the destination server data
3. If you want, you can add up to 3 servers, just fill in the server IP and the connection port to the server.
4. Fill in the **Listen IP** field with the instance access interface IP.
5. Finally keep **Listen Port** with **port 12700**.
:::warning
To set up an access using TLS, use the [Orbit Command Line](/v3-32/docs/orbit-cli) so that the data **Identity** and **Pre-shared key** be presented.
:::

## Monitoring through SNMP
The instance has support for **SNMPv2** and from version 3.8 there is support for **SNMPv3** configured only by Orbit Command Line. See the [Orbit Command Line](/v3-32/docs/orbit-cli) documentation for more details.

Through the **Orbit Web** interface, it is possible to configure the servers allowed to read and the community, through the menu **Orbit Config Manager > Server > Settings**.

:::info
The **SNMP** service will be restarted with each change.
:::

## Monitoring through SYSLOG (SIEM)
The senhasegura is compatible with the most used **SIEM** tools in the market and offers support for the transmission of messages in **CEF**, **Syslog (RFC 5424)**, and **Sensage** formats. 

To configure access the menu **Orbit Config Manager > Settings > Application > Syslog** configuration and fill the following fields:

* **Message format:** Refers to the selected format of the message to be sent, which can be **CEF**, **Syslog (RFC 5424**), or **Sensage**.
* **Notification plugin:** Used only in cases of paid customization projects. Keep this field at its default value. It is not recommended to manipulate this control without the supervision of the Support team.
* **Message sending protocol:** Choose between **TCP** or **UDP**.
* **Network Connector:** Refers to the network connector to send the message.
* **Use network connector:** Indicates if the network connector selected will be utilized in the **Syslog** message-sending configuration.
:::info
Sending syslog messages to the **SIEM** via network connector is only possible when using the TCP protocol. UDP is not supported.
:::
* **Servers for message sending:** A list of IPv4 servers, separated by commas, that will receive the messages.

## Orbit alerts and incidents
Some alerts are specific to modules and features of senhasegura . These alerts are monitored by **Orbit** and forwarded to certain users depending on their criticality. 

To configure the recipients to receive these alerts, go to the menu **Orbit Config Manager** > **Settings** > **Applications** and add the emails in the field **Notification e-mail**. The pending solution incidents will be presented in the menu **Orbit Config Manager > Application > Incidents**.

:::info
The emails will be sent whenever the incident is created or updated. Only the types and event **LOG_EMERG**, **LOG_ALERT**, **LOG_CRIT** and **LOG_ERR** will be notified.
:::
:::warning
Incidents of the type **LOG_CRIT** generate email sending to all users logged in at the moment and will also be echoed to users who are logged in SSH in the instance senhasegura. Users who are in proxy sessions through the senhasegura Web Proxy or senhasegura Terminal Proxy will not receive these echoed notifications.

## Logs
The **Orbit Web** schedules several asynchronous operations of settings that will be applied on the instance server. These operations generate execution logs (not detail logs) that can be followed in the following reports.

* **Application:** All senhasegura application layer logs, including user operations and **Orbit** operations. Alerts also will appears into this logs.
* **API**: **WebService A2A** requests. No sensitive data will be displayed.
* **Operations:** Accessed by the **Orbit Config Manager > Logs > Operations** menu, you will be able to see all **Orbit** operations that have been requested, date/time and request:
    * **Hostname**, **NTP**, **DNS**, **SNMP** and **Gateway** settings definitions.
    * **Zabbix** and **Syslog** definitions.
    * **Backup**, **remote partition** and **Cluster** definitions.
* **Task execution:** Accessed by the **Orbit Config Manager > Logs > Task execution** menu, you can follow the execution of these operations. That is, the moment of change of state of the operation from time to time.
* **Replication**: **Cluster node** status and logs.
* **Backup**: **Backup** definition and execute logs.
* **Database**: **MariaDB** operationa and error log.
