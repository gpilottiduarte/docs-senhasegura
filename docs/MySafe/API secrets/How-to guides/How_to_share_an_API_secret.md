# How to share an API secret

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to share your API secrets with other users registered on the platform.

## Requirements
Have an API secret previously added and valid users. For more information on how to add API secrets, read [How to add an API secret](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-api-secret-add)

## Share an API secret

1. On the senhasegura platform, on the upper left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares, and select **MySafe**.
2. On the side menu, select **API secrets**.
3. On the list, locate the API secret you want to share.
4. In the **Action** column, click on the icon identified by the three vertical dots to open the drop-down menu.
5. Select **Share this API secret**.
6. In the **Share** window, you can search for users by *name, username, email address,* or *group*.

    :::info
    To have the groups displayed in the sharing search, make sure to properly set up **MySafe**'s **Private groups**. For more information, read [How to add a private group](/v3-32/docs/mysafe-private-group-add).

7. Select who to share the API secret with.

    :::danger
    In case you enter an invalid user, the text box will turn **red**, indicating the error.
    :::

1. In the same window, check:
    a. **Can view**: to enable API secret viewing for the chosen user. By default, this box is always checked.
b. **Can edit**: to enable API secret editing for the chosen user.

    :::warning
    Users with the **Can edit** permission are allowed to disable the API secret.
    :::
    

1. Click **Share**.

Once you've finished, you'll see the confirmation message "**Shared**”. Now users you’ve shared the API secret with can access its information according to the configured permissions.

You'll also see a **Yes** in the **Shared** column of the corresponding API secret report. In the **View API secret** window, identified by the magnifying glass, under the **Action** column, you can view the users with access to the API secret and their permissions.

:::info
You can also share the API secret through the shortcut on the home screen of **MySafe**. Locate the API secret you want to share, and click the action menu identified by the three vertical dots, then click **Share**. The shared API secrets are identified by the word “**Shared**”.
