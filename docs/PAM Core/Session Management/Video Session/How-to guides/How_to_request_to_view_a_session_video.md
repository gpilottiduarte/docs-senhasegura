2. In the side menu, select **Access Control** > **Remote Sessions**.
3. On the list, choose the session you want, and, in the **Action** column, click on the **Session video**, represented by the **play** icon.
4. In the **Justification** window, fill in the necessary fields:
    1. In **Justification**, justify why you want to view the session video.
    2. In **Reason**, select the reason you want to view the session video.
