:::info
There are differences between **Access Reason** and **Justification**. Reasons are controlled; their pre-registration is a mandatory step for granting access. After this step, it becomes available in a dropdown menu in the request window, and it also appears in the Access Reasons menu. Justification, on the other hand, is a free text entered by the administrator at the bottom of the request window.
