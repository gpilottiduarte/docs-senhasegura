     5.1 **Host**: enter the hostname or IP address of the AD server.
     5.2 **Port**: enter the LDAP communication port number.
     5.3 **Enabled**: keep it as **Yes**.
     5.4 **Credential for authentication**: select the credential that will be used for user authentication on the server and user synchronization between servers.

     5.11 **Member is DN?**: indicate whether the object is a DN or not.
     5.12 **Bind requires DN?**: indicate whether the authentication will require the Bind-DN to authenticate and connect to the server.
6. Click **Save**.

The **LDAP/AD Servers** home page lists the server.

You can make edits to the registered information. To do so, locate the server in question and click **Edit**, identified by a pencil and paper icon, to make the necessary changes.

 :::info
It's possible to register multiple Active Directory servers in senhasegura, assigning them a priority order. senhasegura uses this order to authenticate users, attempting to log in first to the highest-priority server. If the first authentication attempt fails, the system moves on to the next server in the list and so on. If login fails on all registered AD servers, the user receives a notification stating that senhasegura was unable to authenticate their access.
