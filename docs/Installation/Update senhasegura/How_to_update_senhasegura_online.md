* **Server Time**: Make sure the server time is correctly set.
* **(Situational) Arbitrator**: If your environment includes an Arbitrator, remove it from the cluster.

## Take a snapshot

Snapshots should be taken only when senhasegura instances are offline. This ensures the ability to revert to a previous version if necessary.

1. You can shut down a senhasegura instance using the following command:
```Shell
sudo orbit shutdown
```
2. Once the instance is completely shut down, take a snapshot in the hypervisor. 
3. Reboot your senhasegura instance and update the application.
