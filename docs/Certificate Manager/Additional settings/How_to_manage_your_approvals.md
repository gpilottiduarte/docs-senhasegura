# How to manage your approvals

This article explains how to approve requests from other users within Certificate Manager and track the status of these requests. 

The actions a user can approve for another user are:

* View certificate passwords
* Sign a certificate
* Renew a certificate
* Publish a certificate

## Requirements

* The user must be an **Approver** in the Certificate Manager's access group.
* A Role with the Permissions:
    * **CertificateManager.Requests.Approval.List**
    * **CertificateManager.Requests.Approval.View** 
    * **CertificateManager.Requests.Approve** 

 :::warning
If your user belongs to other access groups with stricter settings, the system will apply these rules, and you won't be able to see the requests. Please ensure that you're not included in any of these groups.
