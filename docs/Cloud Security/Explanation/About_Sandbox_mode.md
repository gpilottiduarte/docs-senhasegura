# About Sandbox mode

Sandbox Mode is a feature within **Cloud Security** that provides a dedicated space for users to experiment, learn, and test various functionalities without linking their personal or corporate accounts. With this isolated environment, users can engage with simulated data and work in a secure and controlled environment for testing the solution.


To enter Sandbox Mode, users can simply click the **Sandbox Mode** toggle button at the top of the page. Once activated, you’ll see the following alert message: "You are in sandbox mode. All data is randomly generated" at the top of the page.

In many cases, Sandbox mode may offer access to features not yet available in the standard environment.
