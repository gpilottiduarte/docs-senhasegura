| Domain | To which domain the credential belongs, and can be used to start sessions on other devices in the same domain. |
| Device | The device where the credential will be able to start sessions. |

| Status | Credential status: Enable or Disable. |
| Password | Credential password. Character Limit: 256. |

## Execution settings

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Parent Credential | Select a credential to be considered the “parent” credential. From that point on, the “child” credential will always assume the same password as the parent credential. |

### Credential password change settings

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Enable automatic change | Select to enable automatic credential change. |
| Enable agent-based password change | This feature that allows users to change their passwords through an automated process facilitated by a software agent is called agent-based password change. |
| Change plugin | Select the plugin used to connect and execute the change on the device. This plugin is linked to several connection protocols, there is no validation that the device has its connectivity active. |
| Change template | Select the template that the executing plugin will execute. In the senhasegura PAM solution, the user has access to a wide variety of templates developed and regularly updated. |

### Authentication Setup

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Use own credential to connect | Select to use the credential itself to connect to the device and perform the password change. |
| Authentication credential | If you don't use your own credential to change the automated password, select which credential will be used to connect to the device. |

It's possible to use a credential to start sessions on the device, and another already registered to perform the password change.

### Reconciliation Credential Setup

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Enables credential reconciliation. Check **Active** or **Inactive** to define the status of the credential. |

This option makes it impossible to use a proxy session that provides the desktop or terminal of the device, as it doesn't prevent the password from being made available to the user. |
| Automation macro (RemoteApp) | Add the RemoteApp macros linked to the credential and available to proxy users. |
| Use own credential to connect | Indicate whether the same credential will be used to authenticate the target device and the RemoteApp. |
| Authentication credential | If you don't use the RemoteApp credential, indicate which credential will be used for the authentication step. |
