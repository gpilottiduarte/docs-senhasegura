# How to set up the Authorities

This article explains how to set up the **Certificate Authorities** feature. A Certificate Authority (CA) is an entity tasked with issuing, renewing, revoking, and overseeing digital certificates. These entities can be either public or private. Registering the authorities lends credibility to the certificate managing process by verifying the authenticity of company interactions and data exchanges.

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then select **Certificate Manager**.
