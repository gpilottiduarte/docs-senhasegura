2. [How to authorize or inactivate a workstation.](/v3-32/docs/go-endpoint-manager-how-to-authorize-or-inactivate-a-workstation)

### Approve user and workstation automatically

User and workstation approvals can be automated to avoid excessive interactions between the person installing the application and the administrator who must approve registrations on the senhasegura platform.

By default, GO Endpoint Manager for Windows doesn’t come with auto\-approval enabled, leaving this decision up to the administrator.

1. On the senhasegura platform, in the upper left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares, and select **GO Endpoint Manager.**
2. On the side menu, select **Settings ➔ Parameters ➔ go Windows.**

	3. **Allow user first link self\-approval?**
4. Confirm the change and click **Save.**
