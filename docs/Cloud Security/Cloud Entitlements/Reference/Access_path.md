# Access path

:::info

The Access path feature is currently available exclusively in **Sandbox** mode.
:::

The **Access path** feature in **Cloud Entitlements** provides users with a comprehensive view of the relationships between identities and the services they interact with.

In essence, it provides a visual representation of how an identity is connected to specific services and permissions, making it easier to identify potential security vulnerabilities or unauthorized accesses.

To access the **Access path** of a specific identity, simply click on the desired identity in the [Identities report](/v3-32/docs/cloud-entitlements-identities-report) and then select the **Access path** tab.
