8. To finish, click **Save**.

After configuring the Just in Time Privilege Elevation, the user has to follow the menu **PAM Core ➔ Credentials ➔ All** and start a session by clicking the **Start a Session** icon.

Before starting the session for the user, senhasegura will connect to the device, perform the credential privilege change and then start the requested session. After the end of the session, senhasegura will connect again to the device and remove the privileges added to the credential.

The session will be monitored with video recording and all commands will be audited. If the administrator has configured session monitoring by Change Audit and the user has done something different than expected, notifications will be sent to those responsible.
