    1. **Access group name***: type a name for the group identification.
    2. **Enabled***: select the option **Yes**.
    3. **Description**: if needed, type a group description.

     :::info
    To ensure that the approver user can access the approval workflow screen, they must possess a minimum of a PAM Operator profile.
    :::
9. At the **Access limitation** tab, set up the permissions that will be valid for this group.
10. Click **Save**.

senhasegura will display a confirmation notice and the group will be displayed in the Access groups list on the main screen.

 :::info
By default, when a user is registered in more than one group with different access settings, the platform will follow the restriction rule by the credential and device combined. However, if the standard option is changed, senhasegura will follow the most restricted rule for that group. To know how to change the default option, access the[ How to deactivate the restriction rule by credential and devices](/v3-32/docs/pam-session-how-to-deactivate-the-restriction-rule-by-credential-and-devices) document.
