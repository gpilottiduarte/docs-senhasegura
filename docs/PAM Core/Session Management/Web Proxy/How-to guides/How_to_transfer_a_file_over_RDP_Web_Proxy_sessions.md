# How to transfer a file over RDP Web Proxy sessions

In this document, youâ€™ll find a step-by-step guide on how to perform the file transfer via an RDP Web Proxy session on senhasegura.

## Requirements

* Have a RDP Web Proxy session available.
* Have the **Enable file transfer for download?*** and **Enable file transfer for upload?*** fields set up to **Yes**. For more information on how to enable this field, access the [System Parameters - Remote Session](/v3-32/docs/pam-session-proxy-settings) document.

---
## Access the session

1. On senhasegura, in the upper-left corner, click on the **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Credentials** > **All**.
3. From the list, select a session that is of the web type.
4. Click on the **computer** icon **(Start session)**.

When starting an RDP Web session and the parameter **Enable file transfer** is enabled, the Web Proxy will make a mapped drive available in the target session, the **G (by default)** driver is mapped and named by **senhasegura**.

 :::info
If the **G** letter is already being used on your machine for another driver, access the [How to configure a remote session (proxy)](/v3-32/docs/pam-session-configure-remote-session-proxy) document, to find out how to make the change.

Through this mapped drive, the user will have access to the files loaded at the destination and will transfer the files from the connected device for download to the workstation.

### To upload

1. Drag a file from the source workstation to the browser window hosting the session.
2. A progress bar for this upload will appear in the bottom-right corner of the session.
3. At the end of the transfer, this file will be available in the root folder of the G driver.

### To download

1. Copy a file from the target device to the folder `G:\Download`.
2. A download window in the bottom-right corner of the browser, and a message will appear in the window when the file has been transferred.
