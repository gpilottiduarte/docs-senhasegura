# How to request access

This document will guide you through a step-by-step on how to request access to view a password from a credential.

## Request access
There are two types of access requests. This choice is made by the admin user when setting the **Access group** configuration:

* **Require reason to view password**: the user requests access, writes down the justification, and has immediate access. The approvers only receive an email with the user’s justification, but no action is required.
* **Require approval to view a password**: the user requests access and writes down the justification, but the access will only be possible after an approver’s action. In this case, the approver must approve the request by email or the senhasegura platform.

To know how to approve a request, access the [How to approve, disapprove, or revoke an access request](/v3-32/docs/pam-session-how-to-approve-disapprove-or-revoke-an-access-request) document.

To request any of these access types, follow the steps below:

1. On senhasegura, in the upper left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and select **PAM Core**.
2. In the side menu, select **Credentials** >  **All**.
3. Choose the credential you want to request access on the list.
4. In the **Action** column, click on the **key** icon.
5. In the pop-up window, called **Justify**, fill in the mandatory fields identified with the asterisk:
    1. **Justification***: describe why you need access.
    2. **Reason***: choose among the available options.
    3. **Governance Code**
    4. **Start access***
    5. **Access end***
     :::info
    **Start** and **end** fields will only be available for **Require approval to view a password** type.
