# How to create an access group

Creating an access group will help with permission settings and user approval flow.

## Create Access Group

To create an access group, go to the menu: **Cloud IAM ➔ Access control ➔ Access Groups.**

1. In the page actions, click on the **New group** option;
2. In the form, include the name of the group and whether it will be active or not;
3. On the **Settings tab**, select the permissions:
   * Whether members of this group can create and edit other users in the Providers Cloud IAM, select which user types can be created and edited by group members.
   * Whether they can exclude other users, select which user types can be excluded by group members.
   * You can create and edit accounts.
   * You can delete accounts.
   * You can create credentials.
   * You can delete credentials.
4. Select a **Template** for user creation, i.e., if this group has permission to create users, it must make them follow the pattern established in the chosen template.InfoSee the section about [Templates](/v3-32/docs/cloud-iam-add-template) to learn more about it.
5. Define whether this group will require approval to perform its activities. To do this, check or uncheck the boxes:
   * **Requires justification:** To carry out their activities, members must describe why they want to do them.
   * **Requires approval:**Needs the previous box to be checked and will cause members to carry out their activities after a request has been sent and approved by another user.
     + Please select how many **a****pprovals required** for the user to perform their requested activity.
     + Select the number of **reprovals required** to cancel the request, i.e., so the user is not allowed to perform the activity.
     + Select whether there will be **approval in levels**, i.e., after a lower member's approval, a higher member can approve or disapprove the request.
     + Define whether it will be mandatory to specify the **governance code** when justifying.
     + And if always, **managers will be included** in the group's list of approvers.
6. On the **Criteria tab**, define what entities the group members will be able to interact with. The criteria could be:
   * Name of the entity you want the members of the group to see.
   * A mask containing the name of the entity, i.e., senhasegura\*.
