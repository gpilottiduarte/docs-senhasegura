# How to manage group synchronization

Group synchronization in an Active Directory (AD) environment refers to the process of replicating information about user groups between different domain controllers or between AD and other systems. This ensures that groups and their respective user associations are consistent throughout the environment, allowing users to have consistent access to resources and permissions, regardless of the domain controller to which they are connected.

To synchronize LDAP/AD groups in senhasegura, follow the steps below.

## Create a new LDAP/AD group

To create a new LDAP/AD group in senhasegura, do the following:

1. In senhasegura, in the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **Settings**.  
2. In the side menu, select **Authentication \> Active Directory \> Group Synchronization**.  
3. In the **LDAP/AD Group Synchronization** report, click on View **Actions**, represented by the three vertical dots, and select **New group**.

## LDAP/AD group window

When you click on **New group**, the **LDAP/AD Group** window will appear. Fill in your group information as shown below

### Settings tab

1. **Name**: fill in the name of your group. For example: `Group_01`.  
2. **Server**: in the drop-down menu, select the server for the group. This server must have been registered previously.  
3. **User group**: in the drop-down menu, select the user group to which this group belongs. This group must have been registered previously.  
   1. You can add a new group by clicking the sum icon next to the **User group** drop-down menu.  
4. **Enabled** indicates the group's status at the time of creation. By default, this option is set to **Yes**.

This can include searching for users, groups, computers, organizational units (OUs), and other directory objects. For example: `(&(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(memberOf=CN=Sales,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com)).`

Just below the text box for **User filter**, a message indicating the output of the synchronization command will be displayed, showing possible synchronization errors.

If you haven't checked the **Raw View** option, the message will be shown as a table. For example:

| User | Username | Operation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `johndoe` | John Doe | `User 'johndoe' will be preserved` |
| `janedoe` | Jane Doe | `User 'janedoe' will be preserved` |

However, if you have checked the Raw View option, this output will be shown as plain text. For example: `[0] => [mensagem] => Error performing group synchronization example: 0x51 Can't contact LDAP server: ldap://ad.example.com.br:38889.`
