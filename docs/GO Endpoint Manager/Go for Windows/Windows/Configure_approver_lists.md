## Create access lists with approval in levels

1. Create an access list for any category **(GO Endpoint Manager➔Policies➔Windows➔Access lists).**
2. At **Workflow**, check the option **Require approval to elevate applications.**
3. After, check **Approval in levels.**
4. Set the number of **Approvals required.**
5. Set the number of **Disapprovals required to cancel.**

CautionThe number of approvals required per level does not equal the number of approval levels. You need to define how many approvers at each level will be required to approve the request.Approvals required, for example:



| Required Approvals | Approval level | Number of approvers per level | Total number of approvers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 1 | 4 | 4 |
| 4 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
| 4 | 3 | 4 | 12 |

The Access control settings are shared with **PAM Core**. If you want to allow the users themselves to approve their request, navigate to **GO Endpoint Manager➔Settings➔Parameters➔Access Control**, and check the option **Allow approvers to approve their own request?\***. Don’t forget to include the users as approvers inside GO too.
