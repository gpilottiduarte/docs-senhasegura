# About events in DSM

In the DevOps methodology, events are vital in initiating actions or reactions within the software development and operations workflow. These events can range from writing code to deploying, monitoring, or resolving issues.

Events in DevOps can be classified into three categories:

1. **Code Changes**: these include commits, branches, pull requests, and merges in the source code repository.
2. **Infrastructure Updates**: these involve configuration changes, server deployments, or infrastructure modifications.
3. **Alerts and other problems**: notifications of issues, such as performance failures, errors, or security breaches.

Efficient management of these events is critical for the success of the DevOps approach. This requires creating continuous delivery pipelines, implementing automation to trigger appropriate responses, and monitoring systems.

The **Audit Track** and the **API Logs** keep track of every operation made in the senhasegura DSM pipeline.
