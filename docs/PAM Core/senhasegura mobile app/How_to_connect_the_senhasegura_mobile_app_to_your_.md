    By selecting **“Only this time”**, this pop-up window will be displayed again every time you need to scan a new code.

    2. Place the QR code inside the indicated area on your mobile device screen. Once detected, the app will generate a key with exclusive access to the login endpoint, and the QR code scanning will start automatically.






:::warning
While the QR code is on the  senhasegura screen, you have 1 hour to scan it. If the time expires, go back to the **My apps** screen and generate a new key following the steps described in the [Enable the senhasegura mobile app](/v3-32/docs/senhasegura-mobile-app-how-to-connect-the-senhasegura-app#enable-the-senhasegura-mobile-app) section of this tutorial.

:::

6. After the QR code is scanned, you’ll receive an email with an 8-digit activation code.

:::warning
As informed in the email, you have 5 minutes to use the 8-digit activation code. If needed, click **Resend code** on the mobile app screen to receive a new code by email.
:::

8.  If the code is correct, you'll either be directed to the **Pending approval** screen or the **Terms of service** screen.

    If the administrator has not determined the need for approval to access the app, you will be automatically directed to the **Terms of Service** screen.
    :::

    :::info
    You can view the approval status on **Grid Menu > SYSTEM > Settings > User management > My requests**. The available statuses are **PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, EXPIRED** and **CANCELLED**.
    :::
