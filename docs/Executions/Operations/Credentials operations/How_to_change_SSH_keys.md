# How to change SSH keys

The SSH key periodically change, is the process of regularly changing the keys used for authentication on a remote system. This method entails creating a new key pair, updating it, and then updating the public key on all devices that can authenticate with the private key.

When senhasegura generates a new key pair, it keeps the private key exclusively while sending the public key to the respective devices.

The process for SSH key maintenance is similar to that outlined for [changing passwords](/v3-32/docs/en/password-change-example), with some differences in the screens and menus utilized. SSH keys, in addition to user and password credentials, must be connected to the respective devices.

## Requirements

* The Pam user permission in senhasegura.
* Have the contents of the public key in the `authorized_keys` of the user's `.ssh` directory.
* Enable ssh key [login on the device](/v3-32/docs/en/devices).

If you enable this field, you should indicate whether this procedure will be done using the same key or another. If you use the same key, select **Use the key itself to connect**. Otherwise, select the corresponding user from the **Credential or SSH key for authentication** dropdown menu.

### In the **Devices** tab
