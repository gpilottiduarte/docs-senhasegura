To create an access group in DevOps Secret Manager, follow the instructions below:

1. On senhasegura, in the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **DevOps Secret Manager.**
2. In the side menu, select **Access control > Access groups.**
3. You'll be taken to the page with a list of all the groups registered with senhasegura.
4. In the top bar, click on **View Actions**, represented by the three vertical dots, and select **New Group**.

In the **Access Group Registration** window, fill in the following:

1. **Access group name**: fill in a name for the access group. This is the name that will identify the access group in senhasegura.
2. **Enabled**: select whether you want the group to be created already active or not. This is set to Yes by default.
3. **Description**: enter a brief description of the access group.

### Settings tab

1. In the **Secrets preview setting**section, fill in the following information:
   1. **Users can view secret**: checkbox, check to allow users to view the secrets registered in senhasegura.
   2. **Requires reason**: checkbox, check to require the user to justify viewing a registered secret.
   3. **Requires approval**: checkbox, check to require that viewing the secret requires approval. This approval must be done by a user with the role of approving user.
   4. **Approvals required:** indicate the number of approvals required for the user to view the secret. By default, the value is 1.
   5. **Disapprovals required to cancel:** enter the number of approvals required to cancel the user's request. By default, the value is 1.
   6. **Approval in levels**: checkbox, indicate whether you want the user to require approvals at different levels.
   7. **Governance ID required when justifying?:** check if you want the user to need a governance code filled in on the justification request. By default, this is set to No.
   8. **Always add user manager to the approvers?**: indicate whether you want to automatically add the user's manager to the group of approvers of their justification. By default, this is set to No.
      1. **Note**: the person responsible for the department is the user's manager.

### Criteria tab

1. In the **Application** section, fill in the following information:
2. **Application names (comma-separated)**: indicate which applications this access group will be allowed to use. Names must be separated by a comma.
3. **Application tags (comma-separated)**: indicate which application tags this access group will be allowed to use. The tags must be separated by a comma.
4. **Line of Bbusiness**: checkbox with the lines of business to which the indicated applications belong.
   1. **Be aware of the following behavior of access groups**: by setting the filtering options to `Empty` in **Line of Business** and **Application Types**, users who are members of the access group will only see applications with no data in these fields. Thus, selecting the `Empty` option will result in the display of applications with unfilled **Line of Busines**s and **Application Types** fields. On the other hand, if the `Empty` option isn't selected, applications with these empty fields won't appear in the results.
5. **Application Types**: checkbox with the types of applications to which the indicated applications belong.

You can use the `[#username#]` wildcard, which will be replaced by the user's name during access processing.

## Update an access group

To update an access group already registered with senhasegura, follow the steps below:

1. On senhasegura, in the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **DevOps Secret Manager**.
2. In the side menu, select **Access control > Access groups**.

## Reprocess access groups

Occasionally, group information may not be visible to users or displayed incorrectly due to configuration problems. The **Reprocess groups** feature can reprocess all group information in such cases. Therefore, if any information isn't visible to you, it may be due to some initial processing problem, which can be corrected by reprocessing.

To use this feature, follow the steps below:

1. On senhasegura, in the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, represented by the nine squares, and select **DevOps Secret Manager.**
2. In the side menu, select **Access control > Access groups.**
3. In the list of groups at the bottom right, click **Reprocess groups.**
4. In the **Confirmation** modal, click **Yes**.
5. A window with a success message will appear after the reprocessing has been completed.

:::danger
When reprocessing groups, some users may lose access to DSM entities.
