# SIEM servers

**Cloud Security** enables the integration of external SIEM servers to track actions performed by users registered under a tenant. You can connect SIEM solutions to receive **Cloud Security** and **Cloud Entitlements** event logs for monitoring and automation.

You can integrate tenants with the majority of SIEM server tools on the market, such as Microsoft Sentinel or ElasticSearch. **Cloud Security** sends messages in the CEF and Syslog (RFC 5424) formats.

:::info
Any SIEM servers that can receive CEF and Syslog message types can be integrated into the **Cloud Security** platform.
:::

To receive the event logs, you must configure a listening UDP or TCP socket on the SIEM server. The listening host and port must be configured in the **Admin console** within **Cloud Security**.
