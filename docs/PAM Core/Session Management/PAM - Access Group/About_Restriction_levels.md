# About Restriction levels

When registering an access group, itâ€™s possible to enable levels of restrictions regarding the viewing of a password and/or access to a session.

The restrictions are:

* Allow access to information
* Allow access by requiring justification from the requester.
* Allow the use of emergency access.
* Allow access within a time range and an approver.

Some PAM entities have attributes that can be used as filters. By using these attribute combinations, you determine what information a group of users will have access to. Some information allows the use of **wildcards** or **masks**.

Properties of **Devices**:

* Name of the device they belong to.
* Model of the device they belong to.
* Device Tags.
* Device website.
* Type of device.

Properties of **Credentials**:

* Credential username.
* Additional information about credentials.
* Credential Tags.
* Credential type.
