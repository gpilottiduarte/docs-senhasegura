## Report to view devices not found

To access this report, go to **Discovery ➔ Discovery ➔ Devices Not Found**.

This report shows devices that could not be found or devices found as assets.

**For example:** Domain discovery finds the device on the first run and automatically imports. If the device is not found in a future run, that device will be recorded in this report.
