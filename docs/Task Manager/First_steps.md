* A [device](/v3-32/docs/pam-devices-management) with a port for remote access configured according to the system.
* A [credential](/v3-32/docs/pam-how-to-set-up-a-credential-in-senhasegura) with permission to execute scripts remotely on the device.
* [Environment registration](/v3-32/docs/task-manager-first-steps#register-an-environment).
* [System registration](/v3-32/docs/task-manager-first-steps#register-a-system).
* [Task reason registration](/v3-32/docs/task-manager-first-steps#register-a-reason-to-run-a-task).
* [Execution templates](/v3-32/docs/task-manager-first-steps#register-an-execution-template).
* [An access group for this module](/v3-32/docs/task-manager-first-steps#create-an-access-group).
