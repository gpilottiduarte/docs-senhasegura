### Unable to connect to remote server URL

**Scenario**: Citrix XenApp - Cannot Contact the Citrix Server: Unable to connect to remote server URL `https://citrixstore/Citrix/Store/PNAgent/config.xml`. The remote server URL may have been entered incorrectly or the remote server may be down. Do you want to re-enter the server URL?
**Solution**: Check the connection between the Citrix Bridge Server and Citrix Store. You can try using the IP address instead of the store's hostname. For example: `http://192.168.0.100/Citrix/senhasegurasf/PNAgent/config.xml`
