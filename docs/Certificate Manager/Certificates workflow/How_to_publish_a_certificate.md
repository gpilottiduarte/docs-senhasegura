# How to publish a certificate

Once a certificate is signed, it can be published on the desired device through senhasegura, which will verify the authenticity and integrity of the information and transactions carried out.

 :::info
You can publish certificates only on devices registered in senhasegura.

senhasegura supports the following publishing plugins: Apache, Tomcat, Nginx, IIS, Kubernetes, Netscaler, IBM Websphere, F5 BigIP, and Palo Alto. With customization/development, the product is also compatible with JBOSS and Wildfly.

## Requirements

* Only certificates ready to be used. Enable the search field below to filter certificates with this specification:

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then **Certificate Manager**.
2. On the side menu, select **Certificates** and then **Certificates**.
3. Locate the desired certificate.
4. In the corresponding **Action** column, click on the three vertical dots icon.
5. Select **Publish Certificate**; this will open the **Publish certificate** form.

### General tab
