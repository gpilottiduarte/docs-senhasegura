<h2>Overview</h2><section class="errorBox"><div class="title">Important</div><div class="content"><div class="content">This feature was deprecated from the senhasegura 3.26 version.

You will only see your registered information or other users’ information that you can access with permission from a direct grant or through an access group.</p><p>You can register the new information through reporting actions or the quick action shortcut.</p><p>Four main features make up protected information:</p><ol><li>The information can be composed of files, text, and passwords. All this information will be protected;</li><li>The information has a name, a type, and an identifier for web services and may receive a compulsory expiration date;</li><li>The information may be linked to a URL and a service without using senhasegura to these attributes. This will be used only for maintainer organization purposes;</li><li>The information can be accessed even if inactive. The information status concerns only its use in the business plan;</li></ol><p>Let us look at these attributes presented in a completed example:</p><p><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib" style="width: 802px;"><span class="fr-img-wrap"><img src="https://cdn.document360.io/5a1d58df-64ce-42a2-8b23-688477d32f33/Images/Documentation/image%28385%29.png" alt="image.png" class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-shadow"><span class="fr-inner" data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-271082" spellcheck="false"><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: Titillium, &quot;Open Sans&quot;, Arial, Verdana, &quot;sans serif&quot;; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;">Registering Personal Information</span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that in the <strong>Information</strong> tab, you can fill in the data that will be protected, such as a file, notes, and password.

Managers can also benefit from this feature when they need to share passwords and generic usernames for their team members.</p><section class="warningBox"><div class="title">Caution</div><div class="content"><p>These personal credentials are unrelated to the credentials associated with devices registered in the vault for password withdrawal and remote sessions.</p></div></section><p>To insert a personal credential in the senhasegura, follow the instructions:</p><ol><li>Go to the menu: <strong>Information ➔ Personal credentials ➔ Personal credentials;</strong></li><li>Click the action button on the report and choose the option <strong>New personal credential;</strong></li><li>Enter the <strong>username</strong> of your credential;</li><li>If you wish to insert the <strong>URL</strong> of this credential;</li><li>In the <strong>Type</strong> field, select the type of this credential;</li><li>Define whether this personal credential will be <strong>Active&nbsp;</strong>or<strong>&nbsp;Inactive;</strong></li><li>It is also possible to generate the password for this credential.
