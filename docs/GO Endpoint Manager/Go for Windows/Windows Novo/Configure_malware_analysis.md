Malware analysis is a feature of GO Endpoint Manager for Windows that allows you to evaluate binaries for which the user requests elevation of privilege. For the analysis, the binary will be forwarded to the [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) online service and evaluated. The binary only runs when categorized as clean on that service.

CautionThe **Malware Scan** feature is not a substitute for an antivirus solution, nor should it be confused as such. This feature reinforces the protection of credentials used by users.
