## Cloud health

At the top of the **Home** page, you'll find the **Cloud health** chart, providing insights into the security levels of your cloud environments registered in **Cloud Entitlements**.

The security of your cloud environments is assessed based on criticality levels, with 0% indicating an unsafe environment and 100% representing a fully secure environment.

3. **Accounts**: displays the accounts of the CSPs connected to the Cloud Entitlements tenant. It’s represented by a blue dot.
4. **Identities**: provides the identities associated with each CSP account connected to Cloud Entitlements. The representation uses dots in different colors to indicate the impact level of the identity in your environment:

| **Dark green** | Lowest impact   |
| **Light green**| Low impact      |
