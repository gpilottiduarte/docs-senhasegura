# How to make an SSH Multihop connection via Terminal Proxy

In this document, you’ll find a step-by-step guide on how to make an SSH connection with Multihop via Terminal Proxy.

This type of access is used to facilitate access to the target device in applications that don’t provide interactive prompts and to perform access by skipping the senhasegura shell step. Multihop serves to connect directly to the destination without the need to perform additional steps.

## Requirements

* Have a command prompt-type application installed.

## Access using multihop
Use the following syntax depending on the desired access, replacing the strings with the values ​​described in the table below:
**String**|**Description**
|---|---|
`senhasegura_user`|User of the senhasegura vault.
`senhasegura_vault`|Hostname or IP address of the senhasegura vault.
`credential`|User’s credential you want to use for access.
`target_device`|Hostname or IP address of the device you want to access.
`domain`|Domain name associated with the device or credential.
`mfa_token`|Code generated by MFA Token.

#### Standard connection only with the user and the senhasegura server:
`ssh senhasegura_user@senhasegura_vault`

#### Multihop connection containing the user and the destination server:
In this example, senhasegura will connect directly to the target server without handing over the intermediate endpoint. The credential and target device are in square brackets
`ssh senhasegura_user[credential@target_device]@senhasegura_vault`

To access the device or when a key and a credential have the same name, using the SSH key, making multihop connections.

`ssh senhasegura_user[key\credential@target_device]@senhasegura_vault`

 :::warning
When accessing another device with an SSH key, always use the word `key\`.
:::

#### Multihop connection using domain credentials:
`ssh senhasegura_user[domain\credential@target_device]@senhasegura_vault`

#### Multihop connection containing the OTP token:
`ssh senhasegura_user[credential@target_device]mfa_token@senhasegura_vault`

The senhasegura Terminal Proxy also offers other types of connections, such as:
