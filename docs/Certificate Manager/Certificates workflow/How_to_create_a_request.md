# How to create a request

A request is the process of seeking the issuance of a digital certificate from a Certification Authority. Requisitions are necessary for senhasegura to understand the type of certificate you want and which authority should endorse it. Every requisition includes a CSR (Certificate Signing Request), which shares vital information with the Certification Authority to generate the certificate.

You can create new requisitions from the product or import existing ones. This article explains how to do both actions.

3. In the top right corner, click **View actions** (the three vertical dots icon).
4. Select **New**; this will open the **Requisition** form.
5. In the **General** tab, enter the information:
    1. From the **Certificate type** drop-down, select the desired certificate type.
