## Access group registration - Settings
In the **Password View Settings** and **Remote Session Settings** sections, you can select the days and time range for which an approval workflow will be required.

These functionalities are independent and can be active in **Password View Settings** but not in **Remote Session Settings**, or vice versa.

Therefore, to enable the approval workflow on certain days of the week and times in **Password View Settings**, the **Require approval to view a password** option must be enabled.

To enable the approval workflow on certain days of the week and times in **Remote Session Settings**, the **Require approval to start session** option must be enabled.

#### Important - Approval and disapproval rule
The rules explained here apply to the fields in the Password preview settings and Remote session settings sections.

When the **Approval in levels** field is enabled, the number specified in the **Approvals required** and **Disapprovals required** fields will indicate the quantity required at each level of approval and disapprovals. In other words, if the number of approvals is set to 2, each level will need to have two approvals. If at any level there is only 1 approval, the requirement won’t be met, and the password can’t be viewed and the session can’t be started.

On the other hand, if the **Approval in levels** field isn’t activated, the number of approvals or disapprovals required will be the general value chosen in the corresponding fields.

Additionally, when using **Approval in levels**, lower-level approvers will initially be notified. Only after approvals have been made by them, the approvers with higher levels will be notified to take their approval actions.

#### Section: Access Request Settings
 :::info
The fields in this section come with a default value filled in, which can be changed as needed.
:::

* **Governance ID required when justifying?***: check whether the applicant must enter an ITMS code at the time of justification.
* **Always add the user manager to approvers?***: check whether the user responsible for the user's department should be automatically queried as an additional approver to this group. Therefore, this user will be alerted with the other approvers in the tab Approvers.
* **Block during freezings?***: check this, so the users in this group can have their session blocked during the session freeze period.

These fields establish the guidelines that all group members must follow in order to access privileged information belonging to this group.
