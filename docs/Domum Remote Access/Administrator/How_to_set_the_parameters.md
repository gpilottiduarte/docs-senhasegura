## How to set the parameters in Domum Remote Access

1. Access the senhasegura platform.
2. In the top left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, indicated by the nine-square box, and select **Domum Remote Access**.
3. On the side menu, select  **Settings > Parameters**.
4. Select **Domum**.
5. The system automatically completes the **Internal user domain** and the **Third-parties domain** fields.
6. In **Enable external authentication***, choose **Yes** or **No**.
    1. If you choose **Yes**, the system automatically completes the **Callback URL for SSO**.
7. In **Automatically grant access on Internal user provisioning***, choose **Yes** or **No**.
    1. If you choose **Yes**, enter a number in **Duration** of access and, from the drop-down menu, select **Minutes, Hours, Days**, or **Months**.
    2. If you don't want a specific group to follow the global settings defined in the previous step, you can specify unique settings when creating or editing an internal user group.
8. In **Initial authentication token**, complete the information.
    1.  In the **Provider** section, choose between sending the token through **email** or **SMS**.
    :::info
    - senhasegura recommends sending the token through SMS so that access information isn't centralized in one location, keeping the procedure more secure. 
    - Zenvia is the only SMS service available.
    :::
    2. Set the **Expiration time of the first token (in minutes)**.
9. Under **Email configuration**, select a **Sending account** for the access link.
10. In  **Notifications**, configure how the notifications will be sent:
    1. In  **Access expiration. Notify**, choose who you want to notify about the expiration. The options are **Access requester, Access user**, or **Requester and User**.
    :::info
    To avoid notifying anyone, simply leave this field empty.
    :::
    2. Under **When notify?**, enter a number and choose the appropriate time unit from the **Before expiration** drop-down menu. You can choose between **Minutes, Hours, Days**, or **Months**. 
11. Click **Save**.

A pop-up window displays a confirmation message indicating the conclusion of the process. Youâ€™ve just established the parameters required to operate **Domum Remote Access**. To complete the initial settings, see how to register an access reason.
