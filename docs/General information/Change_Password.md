Token configuration screen (For security reasons, the displayed QR Code is invalid.)

 

1. Scan the QR code using the OTP tool of your choice. E.g., Google Authenticator.
2. After your first token has been successfully configured in your OTP tool, click the link at the bottom of the screen that says ***click here to validate it***.
3. Now, every time you try to log in, the system will request a valid token to complete the operation.

ImportantYou should only configure your OTP token once. A warning message lets you know if you have already configured a token before.

If you lose access to your token generator, contact the platform's administrator and request that they disable MFA for your account.
