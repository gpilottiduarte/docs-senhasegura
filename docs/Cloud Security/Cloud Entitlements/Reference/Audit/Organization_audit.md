# Organization audit

**Cloud Security** provides an audit report to track all user actions within your organization. This report helps you monitor changes made at an organization level.

## Organization audit report

The organization audit report offers you the following information about actions performed:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Product** | The **Product** column displays the name of the specific product where the action occurred. |
| **User** | In the **User** column, you find the user responsible for the action. |
| **Event** | The **Event** column describes the specific action that the user performed. See the table of [organization-level events](#organizationlevel-events) below for more details on each type of event. |
| **Entity type** | The **Entity type** column specifies the type of entity that underwent a change. |
| **Entity** | The **Entity** column displays the name of the entity that was altered. |
| **Entity ID** | The **Entity ID** column provides the ID of the Entity that was altered. |
| **Date** | The **Date** column indicates the exact timestamp when the action occurred. |

:::info
Users can change the entityâ€™s name, but the entity ID will always remain the same. This ensures that changes can be traced back to the original entity.

To open detailed information about the changes made, click on the action row in the report. This will open a `JSON` file that displays the state before and after the modification.
