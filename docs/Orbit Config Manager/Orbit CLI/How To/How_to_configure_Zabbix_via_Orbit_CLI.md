# How to configure Zabbix via Orbit CLI

This documentt is a guide on how to configure the **Zabbix** via **Orbit CLI** for remote monitoring.

## Requirements

* You must have SSH access with the user account `mt4adm`. For instructions on how to use this feature, refer to the [How to access a SSH admin session into the senhasegura](/v3-32/docs/administration-ssh-access) documentation.

## How to configure Zabbix via Orbit CLI

1. Start an SSH session with the user `mt4adm` on the remote server.
2. Run the command `sudo orbit zabbix`.
```Shell
sudo orbit zabbix
--server=172.10.10.12:10050
--listen=10.66.33.27
--lport=10050 
--tls

```
Where:

* `--server`: defines the IP addresses of the Zabbix server(s), followed by the ports, separated by commas, for example: `1.1.1.1:10051,2.2.2.2:10051`.
:::info
The default port is 10051.
:::
* `--listen`: specifies the IP of the senhasegura server where the Zabbix Agent waits for monitoring requests.
* `--lport`: defines the default port (10050) on which the Zabbix Agent will be ready to receive connections from the Zabbix server.
* `--tls`: optional parameter to encrypt communication between the Zabbix agent and server. Generates an "identity" and a "pre-shared key" (PSK) for authentication and security.
3. Type `Y` to confirm when prompted.

After running the command, youâ€™ll receive the following response:

```Shell
Done!
Zabbix TLS parameters
Identity = BABQUAGCOXknWsRJhvmu
Pre-shared key = 896ee734944dc71ff6f0a6111fb4ec25a8954e3ee0eda07f7ac582952b742eae

```
4. Run the command `sudo orbit zabbix --show` to confirm that the configuration has been applied correctly.

```Shell
sudo orbit zabbix --show

```
This command will display detailed information about the Zabbix Orbit configuration. Ensure to review this information to confirm that all settings are correct.
