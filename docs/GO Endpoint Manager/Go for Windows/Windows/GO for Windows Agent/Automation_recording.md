The application allows GO Endpoint Manager for Windows to authenticate installed applications or web pages accessed directly from the user's workstation. The automation uses the selected credential in GO Endpoint Manager for Windows to fill in the username and password. 

When opening the application, it displays the following image:

* In the top left corner is the search bar.
* In the top right corner is the **Refresh** button.
* Below the Search bar, you have the titles:
	+ **Associated Credential:**this shows which credential is associated with the automation.Automations registered in **RemoteApp** in **PAM Core** are always associated with a credential. If you can view the credential, you can run the automation. Assume you have authentication parameters configured on **RemoteApp**. In this case, the associated credential information will run the automation.
	
	The automation registered in **GO Automation** is available to the user through access lists categorized as automation. Suppose you have authentication parameters configured in automation. In this case, the Automation application will ask the user to choose a credential to run the automation. If you don't have any authentication parameters configured in the automation, you don't need to select a credential.

Automation runs the automation configured in Go Endpoint Manager for Windows and **RemoteApp** in **PAM Cor**e. When executing one automation, the Automation elevates privileges.

## Automation recording

To record the automation registered in GO Endpoint Manager, check if the recording option in the general parameters and the access list is active. If you only mark the general parameter as active and the access list as inactive, the system only records the execution of the RemoteApp automation. Thus, four situations are possible:



| Access list \- Record the session of these applications? | General Parameter/Segregated Parameter \- Allow Session Recording? | Automation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active | Inactive | Not recorded. |
| Active | Active | Recorded. |
| Inactive | Active | Only RemoteApp is recorded. |
| Inactive | Inactive | Not recorded. |

To configure session recording, check the instructions at: [configure parameters for recording](https://docs.senhasegura.io/v3-32/docs/en/go-endpoint-manager-windows-record#configure-parameters-for-recording).

## **Masks for RemoteApp on GO Windows**

The following table presents the supported masks for RemoteApp on Go Windows during automation execution. These masks are used to replace information contained in credentials.



| Tag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| \[username] | Replaces the mask with the credential's **Username.** |
| \[password] | Replaces the mask with the credential's **Password.** |
| \[domain] | Replaces the mask with the credential's **Domain.** |
| \[hostname] | Replaces the mask with the device's **Name.** |
| \[host\_ip] | Replaces the mask with the device's **IP address.** |

## Configure automation on the senhasegura platform \- GO

CautionAutomation doesn't work when Offline mode is active.### Step (1/2\) \- Create the automation

1. Access the senhasegura platform.
2. Navigate to **GO Endpoint Manager ➔ General ➔ Automation**.
3. Create one automation by clicking on the **(****⁝)**icon and **New**.
4. Complete the **Automation Register**form:
	* **Name**: the name of your automation.
