6. Choose the **Reconciliation Credential**.

## Important note
To get reports on your passwords, activate automation with **CORE - Password reconciliation**. Access it through the **Grid Menu > Settings > Execution processes** path. This automation only checks if the password is valid and the access was successful. The scanning happens every fifteen minutes, always looking for passwords that still need to be verified. Once the credential is checked, it will remain unscanned for the next 24 hours.

 :::warning 
Itâ€™s important to note that the automation **only** tests access via the **RDP** and **SSH** protocols. 
:::

**Example**: the automation accesses the user1 credential and tests its access on server1. If successful, the automation generates a report stating that the access worked. If unsuccessful, it generates a report indicating the access attempt failed. Please note that this password will no longer be tested, even if it changes, in a 24-hour period. **The process can be summarized as one test per day per credential with a scan interval of 15 minutes.**

The automation reports will be saved in **Grid Menu > Executions > Password reconciliation**.
