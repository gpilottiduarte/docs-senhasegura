This feature is intended to help administrators take quick defensive action during incidents.

The administrator will revoke all ongoing and future accesses to a Vendor using the**Panic Button** action button.

When the button is in use, if third\-party users attempt to access remotely or view a credential through Domum, they will be immediately logged out. Those who already have access but are not currently using it will not access Domum after this action.

## Access the Panic button

1. Access the senhasegura platform.
2. Go to **Domum Remote Access➔Settings➔Vendors**.
3. In the list, localize the Vendor you want to revoke access to.
4. In the right column, click the **Panic button** action button.

CautionAll users associated with the provider where the Panic Button is triggered will lose their access to Domum

## Return access to third\-party users after using the Panic button

For the third\-party users to regain access, the administrator must request new access for each user.
