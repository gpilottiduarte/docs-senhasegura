### Windows services

O senhasegura performs a discovery through a credential scan, looking for those credentials used by some Windows service.

If you have already conducted a search and want to check which credentials are associated with any service found, access the menu: **Discovery ➔ Discovery ➔ Services**. A report with the credentials found will be displayed.

However, if you have not yet configured the search to find these credentials follow the instructions:

  1\. Please create a new search through the menu: **Discovery ➔ Settings ➔ Discovery** or change one already created.

  


CautionTo configure the search for credentials used by the service, it is necessary to use the search by ***Domain***.  


  2\. Continue to the guide ***Searches*** and select the option ***Identify Windows accounts associated with a service.***

  3\. If you have not yet set up a Windows plugin, go to the ***Plugins*** tab and add a port and a Windows plugin for this scan.

  4\. Lastly, click on ***Save.***

After the scan is complete, you can check the credentials found in the service report (**Discovery ➔ Discovery ➔ Services**).

CautionRemember that their credentials are associated with a service ***Windows***; if your scan focuses on different system devices, the search will not get results.
