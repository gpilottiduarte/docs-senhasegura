# Access control reports

Controlling access to a security system is necessary to prevent unauthorized access to privileged credentials, assets, and other sensitive information stored on the system.

The "Reports" section allows you to print log reports of user and group activities performed through senhasegura. These logs include information such as the date of the action, credentials and user access, and more.

To access these reports, navigate to the "Reports âž” Access Control" menu, where you will find the following reports:
