# Recommendations

Cloud Entitlements evaluates the identities within your Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to detect misconfigurations and offer security recommendations based on your [Security policies](/v3-32/docs/cloud-entitlements-security-policies).

:::danger
If you decide to implement these changes, you must make them directly in your CSP.
:::

All recommendations are centralized in the [Recommendations report](/v3-32/docs/cloud-entitlements-recommendations-report). 

If you need help consulting the security recommendations, refer to [How to view recommendations](/v3-32/docs/cloud-entitlements-how-to-view-recommendations).
