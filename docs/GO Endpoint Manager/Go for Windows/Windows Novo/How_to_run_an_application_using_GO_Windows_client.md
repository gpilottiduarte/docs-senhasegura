# How to run an application using GO Windows client

**PEDM GO Endpoint Manager for Windows** allows users to run applications normally, with elevation of privileges or by impersonating other users.

Follow the steps below to run an application on the GO client for Windows in all the scenarios described.

1. On the desktop of a *workstation* with the **PEDM GO Endpoint Manager** *client* installed, run **senhasegura.go** (Core).
2. In the first column of the application, click on the **Run** option.
3. Select the application you want to run and right-click.
4. Select one of the execution options:
 	* **Run**: runs the application with elevation of privileges of the user logged into the operating system, according to the general and access list parameters. Uses tokens to authenticate with the senhasegura server. It is not necessary to have a user registered with senhasegura **PAM**.
 	* **Run as impersonated user**: runs the application as another user. It is necessary to have a credential registered in senhasegura **PAM**, referring to the user who is performing the action. Authentication is carried out by senhasegura. Requires [impersonation](/docs/pt/go-endpoint-manager-windows-impersonation).
 	* **Run as user (runas)**: runs the application as another user, using the `run as` Windows service. It is necessary to have a credential registered in senhasegura **PAM**, referring to the user who is performing the action.
 	* **Run as non-elevated user (runas)**: runs the application as another user, but without elevation of privileges, using the `run as` Windows service. It is necessary to have a credential registered in senhasegura **PAM**, referring to the user who is performing the action.

:::info
For users in access groups that require approval, the application will be executed after authorization from the administrator.
