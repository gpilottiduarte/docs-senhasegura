# Robots

In senhasegura, tasks that require processing large amounts of information are performed asynchronously.

The triggers initiating processing vary according to the information being worked on. They are usually divided into two types. Tasks performed through scheduling and tasks conducted through a system event. Robots can be understood as services.

## Robots

Accessing the menu **Settings ➔ Execution Processes,** you will have access to the main panel of all robots.

You can change the number of instances of a robot at the field ***Simulate(***Simult.***).***

Robots are kept on hold until the subsequent execution is configured through the execution interval and the start and end time of execution. You can configure the execution range of some robots.

CautionChanging any interval of execution, the number of instances, or switching its status can cause the unavailability of data.

Syslog will notice any changes.
