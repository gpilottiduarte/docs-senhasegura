## Additional settings

### Criticality

This field is an indication of a change in user behavior. For example, a user who normally only accesses low-critical devices, and then starts accessing a high-critical device without explanation, may indicate a risky behavior. There are three values that this field can take: *High, Medium, or Low*.

### Remote sessions settings

### Expressions for login

* Here you can pass regular expressions that can be used by the senhasegura platform to authenticate devices using command line protocols.
* To perform this action, click the **+** icon, identified by the sum button, and fill in the following information:
    * In **Connectivity** select the type of connection from the drop-down menu.
    * In **Expected expression** fill in the regular expression required for login.
    * In **Fill in value** when in Telnet sessions, senhasegura isn’t able to automatically fill in username and passwordm but with this option, it’s possible to pass these parameters.
        * **For example:**
            * **Expected expression**: appears in the terminal when the connection is made. Example: `User:`.
            * **Fill value**: value that must be filled in user, as in the example above. Example: `[username]`.
