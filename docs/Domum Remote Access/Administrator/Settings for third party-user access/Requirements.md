Domum Remote Access can grant access to third parties related to a specific vendor in batch mode. It is a convenient feature to avoid repeatedly selecting the same credentials when granting access.



---

## Requirements

* You must first register each active user of the vendor in an access group, [either individually](/v3-32/docs/domum-create-access-group-for-vendor) or [in batches](/v3-32/docs/domum-batch-register-for-third-parties).

* The vendor must have an associated access group and a registered start date to request valid access.
