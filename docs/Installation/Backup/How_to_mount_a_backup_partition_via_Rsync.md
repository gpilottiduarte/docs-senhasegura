# How to mount a backup partition via Rsync

In this article, you’ll find instructions on how to mount a backup partition via Rsync.

## Requirements

* A user with permission to use Rsync in the target backup device.
* A dedicated directory owned by the Rsync user to be used for the backup (for example, `/home/senhauser/backup_rsync`).
* Rsync installed in the backup server.

## How to mount a backup partition via Rsync

To mount a backup partition via Rsync, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Get the public key of the root user

1. Start an SSH session on your senhasegura server as the user `mt4adm` using port 59022.
2. Run the command `sudo cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`:

   ```Shell
   sudo cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

   $ ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQChIgNXVHrjq3ECwVytNb9k2liB5vGFNNtTDdwSYaYW/WQ8

   ```
3. Copy the displayed public key.
4. Log in to the backup server and paste this public key into the `authorized_keys` file of the backup user:

   ```Shell
   vim /home/rsync/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```
5. Confirm the SSH configuration by executing:

   ```Shell
   sudo  ssh <backup_user@server>
   ```

### Step 2: Set up senhasegura's system backup

1. On the upper left corner of the screen, click the **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares, and select **Orbit Config Manager**.
2. From the side menu, select **Settings > Backup**.
3. Set the **Enable application backup?** parameter to **Yes**.
4. Set the **Mount a remote partition?** parameter to **Yes**.
5. Choose **Send to a remote Linux server (via rsync)** as the backup method.
6. Enter the backup **User**.
7. Enter the backup **Server's hostname** or **IP address**, E.g., `myserver.com` or `10.10.1.5`.
8. Enter the **Remote path** for the backup directory (e.g., `/files/backup/senhasegura`).

### Step 3: Test Rsync backup

1. Start an SSH session on your senhasegura server as the user `mt4adm` using port `59022`.
2. Run the command `sudo orbit backup create`.
3. The command will return an output with the Rsync confirmation and transfer time.
4. Check if you can see the files in the **Remote path** specified for the backup server.

## Backup logs

To check the backup logs, follow these steps:

1. Start an SSH session in your senhasegura server as the user `mt4adm` using port 59022.
2. Run the following command:

```Shell
tail -f /var/log/orbinibkp.log

```
