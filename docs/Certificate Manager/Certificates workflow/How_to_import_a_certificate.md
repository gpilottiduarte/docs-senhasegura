## Import a certificate
 :::info
You can manually add a variety of certificate types, including .cer, .pfx (Private key included, no need to import the key), .p7b, .crt, .der, .p12, .pem.

To manually import a certificate, follow these steps:

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then select **Certificate Manager**.
2. On the side menu, select **Certificates** and then **Certificates**.
3. In the top right corner, click **View actions** (the three vertical dots icon).
4. Select **Import certificate**.
5. Choose a **Certificate file** from your machine. This is the only mandatory field.
6. If your certificate has a separate key file, also select the corresponding **Key file**. 
7. If you'd like your certificate to have a password for the key, enter it in the **Key password** field while you're importing it. You won't be able to add this information later. 
 :::warning
Although adding a **Revocation password** isn't mandatory, it's highly recommended. Certificates lacking this password can be revoked unintentionally by anyone with access to the CA.

Both passwords can be up to 72 characters long, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and the symbols ```! % @ # ^ * _``` .

    a. Select the desired certificate.
9. Click **Save** to confirm the import.

On the **Certificates'** main page, you'll see the certificate you just imported.
