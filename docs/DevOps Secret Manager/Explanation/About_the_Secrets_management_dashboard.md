# About the Secrets management dashboard

The Secrets Management dashboard is accessible through **Grid Menu > DevOps Secret Manager > Dashboard > Secrets Management.**

:::info
The dashboard can display data relating to active or inactive secrets. To choose which to display, click on the drop-down menu at the top of the page and select the option corresponding to the status of the secret in the DSM. You can choose **Yes**, **No**, and **Active** (where **Yes** displays active applications, **No** displays inactive applications, and **Active** displays all applications). In addition, you can filter by time interval from the entity's creation date. To do this, click on the drop-down menu next to the calendar icon and set the desired period for filtering the information.
