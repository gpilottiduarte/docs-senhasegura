# How to set up the Publishing Profiles

This article explains how to set up the **Publishing Profiles** feature. Registering these profiles is important to distribute certificates in a controlled and efficient way. These profiles establish rules and formats for selective disclosure of information while maintaining security and compliance. 

The resulting standardization simplifies administration, minimizes errors, and preserves the integrity of public key systems. Also, when publishing a certificate and selecting a previously registered publication profile, several fields will be filled automatically, speeding up the process.

## Create a Publishing Profile
To create a publishing profile, follow these steps:

1. In the top left corner, click **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares icon, and then **Certificate Manager**.
2. On the side menu, select **Settings**, and then **Publishing Profiles**.
3. In the top right corner, click **View actions** (the three vertical dots icon).
4. Select **New**; this will open the **Publish profile** form.
5. In the **Profile name** field, enter the desired identification.
6. From the **Publishing plugin** drop-down menu, select the desired plugin. Different fields will be enabled in the **Configuration for plugin section** depending on the selected plugin. See how to fill in the specific fields in the [**Publishing plugins**](/v3-32/docs/publishing-plugins) article.

#### Credential for execution section

1. Define which credential will be used to authenticate the devices.
    1. Check **Use a registered credential to access all devices** to enable the credentials.
    2. Select one **Access Credential registered in the system** from the drop-down menu.

 :::warning
* If you want a username as a credential, fill in the **Credential username** field. 
* The system will find this username in all registered devices to authenticate; therefore, the device must have a credential with the same username you typed.

### Servers tab

Ensure that the credential selected in the previous setting can connect to the chosen devices.

2. In the corresponding **Action** column, click on the three vertical dots icon.
