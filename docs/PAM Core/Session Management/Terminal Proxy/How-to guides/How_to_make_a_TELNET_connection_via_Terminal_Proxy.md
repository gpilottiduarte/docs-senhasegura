## Telnet connection
To make a TELNET connection to a device that has this connectivity linked to a valid credential, you’ll need to execute the `telnet` command followed by the credential and device. Follow the steps below:

1. Open the **command prompt** application of your preference.
2. Enter the following command to enter the vault:
    1. ` ssh senhasegura_user@senhasegura_vault`.
         :::info
        The `senhasegura_user` field is the username used to access the vault. The `senhasegura_vault` field can be the hostname or IP address of the vault to be accessed.
        :::
    2. Press the Enter key.
         :::info
        When accessing the device for the first time, a reliability warning will be displayed, type `yes` and press the Enter key. The warning will no longer be displayed the next time this device is accessed.
        :::
3. Enter your password.
    1. Press the Enter key.
4. The senhasegura shell home screen will be displayed.
5. Type `list` so that the list of available credentials and devices is displayed.
     :::info
    If you already know the credential (username) and the device (hostname or IP) that you want to access, it’s not necessary to use the command `list`.
    :::
6. After choosing, type:
    1. `telnet credential@target_device` (hostname or IP address).
    2. Press the Enter key.

After these steps, the TELNET session via Terminal Proxy into the desired device will have been started and ready for use.
