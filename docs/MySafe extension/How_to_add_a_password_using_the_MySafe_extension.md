# How to add a password using the MySafe extension

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to add a password using the **MySafe** extension.

The automatic detection of username and password fields by the **MySafe** extension may not be compatible with all websites, as we rely on the detection standards for these fields.

We cannot guarantee its functionality in all situations due to the security mechanisms of third-party applications. However, we are continually improving the extension to expand support for a greater number of websites.
