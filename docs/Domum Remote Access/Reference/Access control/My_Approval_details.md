There are differences between **Access reasons** and **Justifications**. Reasons are controlled; pre-registering them is a mandatory step for granting access. After this step, it's available in a drop-down menu in the request window and appears in the **Access reasons** menu. The justification is a text entered by the administrator at the bottom of the request window.
