# Criteria tab

In this document, you’ll find all the information about the **Criteria** tab from the registration screen for a new access group. In this section, it’ll be decided which devices and credentials the group's users can access.

## Access group registration - Criteria

**Item**|**Description**
---|---
**Device (comma separated)**|Device registration name. In the text [Device field](#device-field) there are possible ways to fill in this field.
**Product (comma separated)**|Device model.
**Username (comma separated)**|Credential username. In the text [Username Field](#username-field) there are possible ways to fill in this field.
**Additional information (comma separated)**|Text with additional information about registration.
**Device tags (comma separated)**|Tags registered for devices.
**Credential tags (comma separated)**|Tags registered for credentials.
**Site***|Checkbox to select the types of sites that will be visible to the group. The options are: *All* and *Default*.
**Type of device***|Checkbox to select the types of devices that will be visible to the group. The options are defined according to the types of registered devices.
**Credential type***|Checkbox to select the types of credentials that will be visible to the group. The options are: *All, SSH Key, Domain Admin, Domain User, Local User* and *Local administrator*.

### Device field
The **Device** field can be filled with some combinations that facilitate the choice of devices that will be available for that access group.

The combinations are:

* The device’s name plus the device IP number. For example: **DEVICE-ABC(100.100.100.100)**, the group will be able to device which has exactly that name and IP.
* One asterisk at the beginning plus a part that contains the device’s name plus an asterisk at the end. For example: **`*device*`** will be available to the group the device that contains the word device **somewhere** in the name.
* The beginning of the device’s name plus an asterisk at the end. For example: **`device*`** will be available to the group the device that contains the word device at the **beginning** of the name.
* The beginning of the device’s name with an asterisk in the middle and the end of the device name. For example: **`device*final`** will be available to the group the device that starts with **device** in the name, has some **other word in between** and ends the name with the word **final**.

### Username field
When the credential’s username matches the senhasegura’s username, you can use the mask **`USERNAME`** to ensure that only visible credentials are those with the same senhasegura’s login username.

For example, the username used to access the senhasegura instance is **“john”**, and the group rule will be that only John will have access to credentials with the same username, which means, only credentials in which the credential's username is also **“john”**.

For this to be possible, the following syntax will be used to fill the field:

* **`[#USERNAME#]`** which will bring only the credentials that have exactly the name of john.
* **`[#USERNAME#]*`** which will bring all the credentials that have john at the beginning, regardless of how the ending turns out.
* **`*[#USERNAME#]*`** which will bring all the credentials that have john in the middle of the credential name, regardless of how the beginning and the end are.
