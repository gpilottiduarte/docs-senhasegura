# Reference for credential types

Access the Credential types report via **Grid Menu > PAM Core > Settings > Credentials > Credential types**. Clicking on this option will take you to the **Credential types** screen.

To search for the different types of credentials registered, click on the **Show filters** button, identified by the magnifying glass icon in the top bar.

## Search fields

The following fields are part of the search components.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ID | Registration code for the type of credential. |
| Name | Name of the credential type. |
| Local user? | A drop-down menu with **Yes** and **No** options. Local users are those who can't log in to domains. |
| Enabled | A drop-down menu with **Yes** and **No** options. |

Click **Filter** to perform the search, and **Clear** to clear the search fields.

## List of credential types and possible actions

The list of credential types will be presented with the same fields as the search, except the **Action** column. In the **Action** column, you'll find two options:

- **Edit**: identified by the paper and pencil icon.
- **Delete**: identified by the trash can icon.
