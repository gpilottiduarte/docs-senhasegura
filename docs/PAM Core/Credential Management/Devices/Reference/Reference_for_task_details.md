### Affected entities section

Since bulk operations can be performed on various senhasegura artifacts, it's worth noting that you can have different ways of presenting the information.

For example, when secrets come from a bulk operation in the **DevOps Secret Manager (DSM)**, there will be no Affected Entities section. Therefore, the fields for Credentials and Devices are shown below.

#### Affected entities - Devices
