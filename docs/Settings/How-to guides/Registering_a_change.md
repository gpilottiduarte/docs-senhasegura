# How to register a change

On critical, service\-responsible servers, it is widespread for changes executed in these environments to be highly controlled.

In such cases, the user requests access to a device, and the administrator releases access where he will perform the task. The auditor needs to know in what script, device, and when the user will act. For *compliance*, it is necessary to follow or check the logs of executed commands physically.

These activities have a very high risk because the user can make an execution that directly affects a company's productivity. The user can, for example, stop an Apache server hosted on the company's commercial site or even take improper actions to steal information.

The ***Change Audit*** module assists the administrator in ensuring that the necessary changes to a server will happen correctly. It provides an approval flow to access and confirms that the user executed everything he had to. It facilitates auditing and compliance.

The module also indicates whether the user reached the expected result or executed more than necessary. It shows even if the user made the change correctly.

It gives more security to the professional responsible for the environments, having audit and compliance of the commands executed inside their devices.

Another advantage is the possibility of splitting the workflow, where one user can be responsible for planning and creating the script and another for executing it.

Among other benefits, this module can help:

* Granting privileges to users in the authorized environment only.
* Prevention, detection, and correction of security abnormalities in the environment.
* Creation of inviolable audit trails for privileged operations.

Follow the instructions in the following sections to understand how to use this module:
