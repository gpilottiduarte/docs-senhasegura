## Creating a PostgreSQL discovery

When the plugin option is selected, discovery will discover credentials within PostgreSQL type databases.

1. Select the module **Discovery ➔ Settings**
2. Click on the Actions menu and choose the **New** option
3. Select the option by type of **Device**
4. Select the **Searches** tab and check the **search for credentials** checkbox
5. Click on the **Plugins** tab and choose the **PostgreSQL** option
6. Fill in the other fields and save

In **Discovery ➔ Discovery ➔ Credentials**, the credentials found by discovery will be listed and can be viewed in this report.

### Execution tab

In this tab you can configure the period and interval of execution of this discovery configuration. Configurations that may take longer to execute compared to the configured period, will not be executed concurrently. In other words, executions of the same configuration are not carried out in parallel. Only different configurations are performed in parallel.

Be careful to configure very short intervals for configurations that need to look for large network intervals and evaluate various artifacts.

The shortest configurable interval is one hourly run.
