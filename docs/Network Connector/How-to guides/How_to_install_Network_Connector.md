# How to install Network Connector

In this document, you’ll find a step-by-step guide on how to install the **Network Connector**.

The installation and configuration of the **Network Connector** is divided into the following steps:

1. Configuration of **Network Connector Server**.
2. Registration of agents in senhasegura **PAM**.
3. Obtain the **Network Connector Fingerprint**.
4. Install the **Network Connector Agent**.
5. Set the version of **Network Connector Agent**.

## Requirements

* For 250 simultaneous connections per active SNC - **1GB memory, 1 VCPU, 1GB network card, at least 40GB available storage**.
* For 750 simultaneous connections per active SNC - **2 GB memory, 2 VCPU and 1 GB network card, at least 40 GB of available storage**.
* For 1500 simultaneous connections per active SNC - **4 GB memory, 4 VCPU and 1 GB network card, at least 40 GB of available storage**.

O *Server* needs to be configured only once. The agent, in turn, must be installed and configured on all networks that senhasegura does not have access to.

## 1. Configure the Network Connector Server

The configuration of the **Network Connector Server** is carried out in the senhasegura instances with the command orbit network-connector.

 :::info 
Run the command orbit network-connector --help to know all the options available for this command. 
:::

For these commands to have the expected result, you must have administrator access `sudo` to the senhasegura server and the port `TCP/51445` must be released for the agent to communicate with the server.

 :::warning 
For cluster installations, it is necessary to configure the Network Connector Server at all nodes. To do this, simply repeat the steps above on each node in the cluster. 
:::

Follow the steps below to install and configure the **Network Connector Server**:

1. Access each senhasegura instance in the cluster via terminal and run the command `sudo orbit network-connector` setup.
2. Enter the key AND, to confirm the operation.

The operation may succeed and return a success message:

```
senhasegura Network Connector Server is ready!

Use this fingerprint in senhasegura Network Connector Agents setup: "FINGERPRINT"

In case you need it, instructions for starting senhasegura Network Connector Agents are available in our help center.

See at https://d.senhasegura.io/skme2rugfyizbw9

NOTE: If this environment is in cluster mode, run "sudo orbit network-connector setup" on secondary nodes as well
```

Or unsuccessful and return one of the errors below:

```
Can't continue setup.

This node is a Secondary in cluster and senhasegura Network Connector Server needs to be initialized in Primary node.

Please run "sudo orbit network-connector setup" in Primary node first.

==================================or=====================================

Whoops! An error was found in application setup.

Check if application database is running and file replication between nodes is working without errors.

==================================or=====================================

Whoops! An error was found!

Unable to determine which fingerprint senhasegura Network Connector Agents needs to connect in this server, try again later.

==================================or=====================================
 
Whoops! Could not replicate settings to cluster nodes

Check if all cluster nodes are available, file replication is working and try again.
```

## 2. Register Network Connector Agents on senhasegura

After activating the **Network Connector Server**, access the senhasegura web interface and follow the steps below:

1. In senhasegura, access the **Connectors** page, using the path **Grid menu** > **Devices** > **settings** > **Network Connector** > **Connectors**.
2. In the Action column, click the **Edit** icon.
3. Click on the **Agents** tab.
4. Click on the **Agents +** button.
5. Add all the agents you want to install by filling the fields **Name** and **Port**. The port must be between 30000 and, 30999.
6. Click the **Save** button.

## 3. Get the Network Connector Fingerprint

To install the agents, you must have the *fingerprint* generated during the configuration process of the **Network Connector Server**.

To copy the fingerprint, follow the steps below:

1. In senhasegura, access the **Connectors** page, using the path **Grid menu** > **Devices** > **settings** > **Network Connector** > **Connectors**.
2. In the **Action** column, click the option **Details**.
3. When the window opens, click on the icon **fingerprint**.
5. Select and copy the **fingerprint**.

## 4. Install Network Connector Agent

To install the **Network Connector Agent** It is necessary to have basic knowledge of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Furthermore, it’s necessary that the environment where the agent and the Linux server (any distribution) have the [Docker Compose Standalone](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/other/) installed and configured. When installing the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on the Linux server, use the **Linux Standalone** binary.

 :::warning 
The Network Connector Agent must not be installed on senhasegura instances. 
:::

To install the **Network Connector Agent**, follow the steps below:

1. On a Linux machine that meets the requirements described above and is on a network to which senhasegura does not have access.
2. Write the file docker-compose.yml with agent settings (examples below). Pay attention to the fields:
	* `SENHASEGURA_FINGERPRINT`: value obtained previously.
	* `SENHASEGURA_AGENT_PORT`: Set a port between 30000 and 30999 for this agent. Choose one that is not in use.
	* `SENHASEGURA_ADDRESSES`:
		- In cases of standalone installation: IP address of the instance. Example: `192.168.10.20`.
		- In cases of cluster installation: IP addresses of the senhasegura instances, separated by commas, without spaces. Example: `192.168.10.20,192.168.10.21`.
	* `SENHASEGURA_AGENT_SECONDARY`: optional field. Could it be `true` or `false`.
3. Run the command `sudo docker-compose up -d`.

Example of the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
services:
 senhasegura-network-connector-agent:
   image: "registry.senhasegura.io/network-connector/agent-v2:latest"
   restart: unless-stopped
   networks:
    - senhasegura-network-connector
   environment:
    SENHASEGURA_FINGERPRINT: "CHANGE_ME"
    SENHASEGURA_AGENT_PORT: "CHANGE_ME"
   SENHASEGURA_ADDRESSES: "CHANGE_ME"
    SENHASEGURA_AGENT_SECONDARY: "false"
networks:
 senhasegura-network-connector:
   driver: bridge
```

 :::info 
You can follow the agent execution logs using the command `sudo docker-compose logs -f`. 
:::

## 5. Set the agent version

You can define the version of the agent to be used by changing the version of the container image. The choice is determined within the `docker-compose.yml` file.

If you leave it with the option latest, as in the examples above, you will be using the latest available version of the agent: `image: "registry.senhasegura.io/network-connector/agent-v2:latest"`.

To use the agent in other versions, use `image: "registry.senhasegura.io/network-connector/agent-v2:3.32"`.

 :::info 
Try to keep the agent version equivalent to the version of senhasegura used by the agent at the time.
