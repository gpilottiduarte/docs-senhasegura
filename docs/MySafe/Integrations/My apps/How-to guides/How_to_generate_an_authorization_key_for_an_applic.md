# How to generate an authorization key for an application

This tutorial will guide you through a step-by-step process on how to generate an authorization key for an application to connect with **MySafe**.

## Generate an authorization key

1. On the senhasegura platform, in the upper left corner, click the **Grid Menu**, identified by the nine squares, and select **MySafe**.
2. In the side menu, select **+ Integrations > My apps**.

    
    :::info
   You can also access the **My apps** page by clicking on your username in the upper right corner of the screen. In the drop-down menu, click **My apps**, represented by the key icon.
    :::
    
  3. In the upper right corner, click **View Actions**, represented by the three vertical dots, and select **+ New key**.
  4. In the **My apps** window, complete the information:
      1. **Name***: enter a name for the application.
      2. **Expiration date**: enter a date to set an expiration date for the authorization key. Enter the date in the first field and the time in the second field. In each field, there’s a downward arrow you can click. In the first field, clicking on it, will display a calendar, and in the second field, you’ll view a list of times. 
        :::info
        If you don't set an expiration date, the key will only expire if you exit the application or manually revoke the key.
        :::
      3. **Application type***: choose the type of application to use. The available options are **Mobile app** and **Extension**.

:::info
The items with an asterisk are mandatory.

5. Click **Save**.

Once finished, you’ll be directed to a new screen with a QR code and a manually enterable code right below the QR code. 

:::warning
The generated authorization key is for single-use only. Therefore, you can’t view it more than once. In case of loss or any other issue, you’ll need to revoke the key and generate a new one.
