Check if you have a rule with the File Hash criteria. Suppose you have an access list with Product Name, Directory, and File Hash. Only the File Hash will be considered, and all other criteria will not. And if it is an access list with more than one Hash of the file, they are considered with the evaluation of an "OR" condition.
