# Create an authenticated URL for a web proxy session

This article presents how to create an authenticated URL for a web proxy session in **PAM Core** via API, the available endpoints, the parameters needed, example requests, and expected responses on success or in case of errors.

## Authorization

To get started, make sure **Web Proxy Session** is listed under **Authorized resources** in your **A2A** module. For more information on authorization, access the [How to create an authorization for an application](/v3-32/docs/a2a-how-to-create-an-authorization-for-an-application) documentation.
