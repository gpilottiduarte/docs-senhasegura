# Deactivate and activate a device

This article presents how to deactivate and activate devices in **PAM Core** via API, the available endpoints, the parameters needed, example requests, and expected responses on success or in case of errors.

## Authorization

## Authentication
Each request in the API must have the **OAuth Consumer Key** and the **OAuth Token** of the client. 
For more information on authentication, access [How to authenticate an application](/v3-32/docs/a2a-how-to-authenticate-an-application).
